Unveiling Consumer Behavior: Analysis and Prediction with Data Science

Understanding consumer behavior is essential for the success of any business in today's market. With the vast amount of data available, data science provides powerful tools to analyze and predict consumer actions. In this article, we will explore a real case study from a large marketplace, demonstrating how data analysis and machine learning techniques can be applied to uncover behavior patterns, optimize marketing strategies, and increase customer loyalty. We will dive into the theoretical and practical concepts underlying this process, providing valuable insights for those looking to leverage their e-commerce operations.
Consumer Behavior 
In consumer marketing, the consumer lifecycle is a term used to describe the progression of steps a customer goes through when considering, buying, using, and maintaining loyalty to a product or service.
Why It's Important
These metrics can be tracked over time (e.g., quarter over quarter, year over year) and compared to industry-wide benchmarks. Comparing Customer Lifecycle metrics can help solve competitive gaps in product or service offerings and especially predict which consumer will buy from the store.
Propensity to Purchase
We want to measure a consumer's propensity to buy. Why is this important? For several reasons. First of all, I can't lose this customer, then I can create points of contact to drive the sale, and lastly, I increase my chance of selling significantly by interacting with the most likely consumers to buy.
Consumer Behavior: Definition: The consumer lifecycle describes the steps a customer goes through when considering, purchasing, using, and maintaining loyalty to a product or service. Importance: Measuring these metrics over time helps to identify gaps in product offerings and predict future purchasing behaviors.
Propensity to Buy: Measure: Important not to lose consumers, create points of contact and increase the chances of a sale. Example: Identification of consumers with a higher propensity to buy (e.g., 73%) versus a lower propensity (e.g., 11%).
Counterfactual Modeling: Description: Measures the impact of interventions on churn. Example: Churn lift ranging between 11% and 17%, with actual results at 16%.
Business Case - Target: Problem: Loss of millions of dollars due to potential buyers switching to competitors. Solution: Predict behavior and optimize interactions to retain customers.
From Data Lake
The architecture of a Data Lake is a data storage solution designed to manage large volumes of data coming from multiple sources. The Data Lake framework is made up of several layers, including the ingestion layer, where structured and unstructured data is collected from both streaming and batch sources. The data is then processed at the processing layer, where it is validated, cleaned, and transformed. After processing, the data is stored in the storage layer, which is divided into landing, cleansing, and curation zones. In addition, the cataloging and search layer allows for organization and easy retrieval of data. Finally, the processed data is made available at the consumption layer, where it can be used for analysis and visualization, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
