# Unveiling Consumer Behavior: Analysis and Prediction with Data Science

Understanding consumer behavior is essential for the success of any business in today's market. With the vast amount of data available, **data science** provides powerful tools to analyze and predict consumer actions. In this article, we will explore a real case study from a large marketplace, demonstrating how data analysis and machine learning techniques can be applied to uncover behavior patterns, optimize marketing strategies, and increase customer loyalty. We will dive into the theoretical and practical concepts underlying this process, providing valuable insights for those looking to leverage their e-commerce operations.

## Consumer Behavior

In consumer marketing, the **consumer lifecycle** describes the progression of steps a customer goes through when considering, buying, using, and maintaining loyalty to a product or service.

### Why It's Important
These metrics can be tracked over time (e.g., quarter over quarter, year over year) and compared to industry-wide benchmarks. Comparing **Customer Lifecycle metrics** can help solve competitive gaps in product or service offerings and predict which consumer will buy from the store.

### Propensity to Purchase
Measuring a consumer's **propensity to buy** is crucial for several reasons:
- Avoid losing customers.
- Create points of contact to drive sales.
- Increase chances of selling by interacting with likely buyers.

### Consumer Behavior Summary:
- **Definition**: The consumer lifecycle describes the steps a customer goes through when considering, purchasing, using, and maintaining loyalty to a product or service.
- **Importance**: Measuring these metrics helps identify gaps in product offerings and predict future purchasing behaviors.

### Propensity to Buy Summary:
- **Measure**: It's essential to track consumers' likelihood of purchase to increase chances of sales.
- **Example**: Identify consumers with a higher propensity to buy (e.g., 73%) versus a lower propensity (e.g., 11%).

### Counterfactual Modeling:
- **Description**: Measures the impact of interventions on churn.
- **Example**: Churn lift ranging between 11% and 17%, with actual results at 16%.

## Business Case - Target

- **Problem**: Loss of millions of dollars due to potential buyers switching to competitors.
- **Solution**: Predict behavior and optimize interactions to retain customers.

## From Data Lake

The architecture of a **Data Lake** is designed to manage large volumes of data from multiple sources. Its framework consists of several layers:

1. **Ingestion Layer**: Collects structured and unstructured data from both streaming and batch sources.
2. **Processing Layer**: Validates, cleans, and transforms data.
3. **Storage Layer**: Divided into zones (landing, clean, curated) for data storage.
4. **Cataloging & Search Layer**: Organizes and facilitates data retrieval.
5. **Consumption Layer**: Data is made available for analysis and visualization.

This architecture enables efficient ingestion, storage, processing, and consumption of large volumes of data.

### Typical Data Lake Ecosystem:
- **Streaming and Batch**: Data can be continuous (e.g., Twitter) or batch (e.g., spreadsheets).
- **Ingestion Layer**: Collects structured and unstructured data from various sources.
- **Storage Layer**: 
  - **Landing Zone**: Raw data storage.
  - **Clean Zone**: Data is validated, cleaned, and standardized.
  - **Curated Zone**: Transformed, enriched, and modeled data.
- **Processing Layer**: Data processing pipeline for cleaning, transforming, and enriching data.
- **Cataloging & Search Layer**: Enables data organization and searchability.
- **Consumption Layer**: Data consumed through dashboards, analytics, and reports.

### Solutions with Data Science:
1. **Preliminary Models**: Use machine learning to predict churn and propensity to buy.
   - *Tools*: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R (caret).
2. **Real-Time Data Analysis**: Implement real-time analytics systems to monitor consumer behavior.
   - *Tools*: Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Develop targeted marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.
   - *Tools*: K-means clustering, cluster analysis.
4. **KPI Tracking**: Monitor consumer behavior KPIs and adjust strategies as needed.
   - *Tools*: Power BI, Tableau.
5. **Automation and Customization**: Create automated, personalized campaigns to engage customers.
   - *Tools*: HubSpot, Marketo.

### Implementation in Data Lake:
1. **Ingestion Layer**: Collect data from multiple sources (e.g., app interactions, social media).
2. **Processing Layer**: Validate, clean, transform, and enrich data.
3. **Storage Layer**: Data is stored in landing, clean, and curated zones for analysis.
4. **Consumption Layer**: Data is consumed through BI tools and dashboards for decision-making.

These solutions will enable a deeper understanding of consumer behavior and help improve retention and sales through actionable insights.

## Our Case

### Collection of Information
Within the shopping site or mobile app, we collect metrics from logged-in users. Metrics include:
1. **SESSION_ID**: Unique identifier of the session.
2. **Click_Image**: Indicator if the user clicked on an image.
3. **Read_Review**: Indicator if the user read a review.
4. **Category_View**: Indicator if the user viewed the category.
5. **Read_Details**: Indicator if the user read product details.
6. **Video_View**: Indicator if the user watched a product video.
7. **Add_to_List**: Indicator if the user added the product to the list.
8. **Compare_Prc**: Indicator if the user compared prices.
9. **View_Similar**: Indicator if the user viewed similar products.
10. **Save_for_Later**: Indicator if the user saved the product for later.
11. **Personalized**: Indicator if the user used personalized recommendations.
12. **BUY**: Indicator if the user purchased the product.

In our case study, 1 million records were collected, representing 1 million sessions with user interaction. Below is a part of the csv table with the result of the collection:
